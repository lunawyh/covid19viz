<ul>
    <li>0:06 – Public Information Officer, Kerri Schuette, gives an update on Shasta County’s COVID-19 numbers (current as of 6 p.m. on 5/12/2020).</li>
    <li>1:23 – Shasta Regional and Mayer Memorial reassures the community that the hospital is taking many precautions and people should go in to get care when they need it, saying “we're prepared and we're ready and we're here to help you.” Some people have been putting off accessing medical care because of their concerns for contracting the virus. </li>
    <li>2:52 – Health Officer, Dr. Karen Ramstrom talks about the state’s acceptance of the attestation letter, and that we are allowed to move into phase two a little faster than some other areas of California. She reminds the community that phase two still requires adaptations to be made to the way we go about our daily lives, including social distancing, hygiene, extra environmental cleaning, no nonessential travel and no mass gatherings. Businesses can find guidance on all of the practices on ShastaReady.org under the Roadmap to Recovery.</li>
    <li>6:14 – HHSA Director, Donnell Ewert talks about Hospital Week, Mental Health Month and the mental wellness resources available on ShastaReady.org under “Taking Care of Yourself.”</li>
    <li>8:34 -Sheriff Magrini responds to a question about the rodeo’s impact on the attestation letter.</li>
    <li>9:37 – Dr. Ramstrom responds to a question about malls, saying retail stores are able to reopen with adaptations for safety and social distancing. Restaurants can open for dining in with adaptations, serving up to groups of ten, but the groups of ten should consist of people living in the same household. Businesses and restaurants can find this information about the adaptations on ShastaReady.org under Roadmap to Recovery. </li>
    <li>13:50 – Sheriff Magrini responds to a series of questions about the Cottonwood Rodeo and enforcement through education.</li>
    <li>21:29 – Dr. Ramstrom talks about everyone doing their part to keep numbers low That it is up to every single one of us to be responsible and not partake in those activities that are currently prohibited, because we're all doing that in order to let our businesses reopen and be successful.</li>
    <li>23:12 – Donnell Ewert also talks about everyone doing their part and that, with how communicable disease spread works, attending a mass gatherings can have effect on more than just the patrons of an event. It is possible to get infected and bring the virus to work or to home and spread the disease.</li>
    <li>26:26 – Dr. Ramstrom and Donnell Ewert respond to a question about the recommendation that people who attended the rodeo get tested at the state testing site, as well as a question about the cost of testing. Testing at the Shasta College site is free, but insurance may be billed for those who have it, but there’s no copay. It is free for those who don’t have health insurance.</li>
    <li>28:50 – Dr. Ramstrom responds to a question about hair salons and how long it will take for them to reopen, saying that how quickly we move through phase two will be dependent on the COVID-19 data. We’ve kept our numbers low by staying at home, and the slow reopening is necessary so that Public Health has the resources to contain the spread.</li>
    <li>30:48 – Mayers and Shasta Regional respond to a question about visitation and when those restrictions might be loosened.</li>
    <li>35:02 – Dr. Ramstrom responds to a question about how much testing would be needed to get a picture of how infected Shasta County is and talks about what take to have community immunity, for which a vaccine will be required.</li>

<ul>
    <li>0:50 – Shasta County Health Officer, Dr. Karen Ramstrom, gives an update on preparations being made locally in anticipation of the governor’s revision of the stay-at-home order and the gradual, careful loosening of restrictions thought to take place in phase two.</li>
    <li>3:11 – Robert Folden, Chief Operating Officer at Mercy Medical Center, and Valerie Lakey, Emergency Operations Director at Mayers Memorial Hospital give updates on the gradual increase in elective surgeries being allowed in their facilities and the possibility of changes to visitation policies. </li>
    <li>6:08 – Donnell Ewert, Director of the Shasta County Health and Human Services Agency, reminds the community that several aspects of phase one of the governor’s stay-at-home order will continue into phase two – large gatherings will not be allowed, travel in or out of Shasta County should only be for essential purposes, such as medical appointments, and people in high risk groups, those over 65 and people with underlying medical conditions, are highly encouraged to continue to stay at home, only going out to take care of basic needs.</li>
    <li>8:45 – Dr. Ramstrom talks about the Roadmap to Recovery Plan, which is expected to be made available to the public shortly after the governor publishes the updated order on Thursday, May 7<sup>th</sup>.</li>
    <li>10:31 – Dr. Ramstrom fields a question about what number defines a “large gathering.” Currently, gatherings of any size are not allowed, but that may change as things move into phase two and will be based on current data, CDC and state guidelines. Still, the change would be gradual and cautious.</li>
    <li>12:15 – Dr. Ramstrom responds to a question about what types of businesses will be allowed to open in phase two, saying that the governor’s revised order will provide detailed information once it is made public.</li>
    <li>13:28 – Donnell Ewert fields a series of questions about the demobilization of the Field Medical Station that was set up at the Redding Civic Auditorium. </li>
    <li>19:12 – Dr. Ramstrom provides some clarification about which types of essential workers, beyond healthcare workers, qualify to make an appointment at the state testing site at Shasta College.</li>
    <li>22:00 – Dr. Ramstrom responds to a question about enforcement policies with businesses, which continues to be a “soft-touch” educational approach. </li>
    <li>25:29 – Dr. Ramstrom fields a question about the streak of days with no new positive tests, and talks about how that is a sign our area greatly benefitted from the stay-at-home order, but not an indicator that the virus is gone. Some continued low level spread of COVID-19 is expected.</li>
    <li>27:06 – Dr. Ramstrom and Donnell Ewert emphasize that we are not out of the woods yet and it will take a high degree of community immunity to return to life like it was before the pandemic started. Donnell said, “I like to think of this as the end of the beginning, the second inning of a nine-inning game.” We have a very long way to go, but also have the surveillance (testing, contact tracing, etc.) needed to move forward. </li>
    <li>29:57 – Dr. Ramstrom responds to a question about the state’s recruitment people to help with contact tracing, and talks about how that will be a very valuable resource to us if a surge in cases occurs and it makes it difficult for the HHSA’s contact tracing team to carry the load.</li>
    <li>33:08 – Local hospitals talk about their plans for celebrating Nurse’s Day and Hospital Week.</li>

    <li>11:45 – Director of Shasta County Health and Human Services, Donnell Ewert, thanks the community, especially businesses, for their efforts and sacrifices during the stay-at-home order, noting that it’s made a very big difference in our numbers, and that we need just a few more weeks of patience to help keep those numbers low. He also talks about Public Health Branch Director, Brandy Isola’s decision to leave HHSA, thanking her for her more than 18 years of service, and emphasizing to the public that her leaving does not leave a hole in the Emergency Operations Center.</li>
    <li>14:55 – Dr. Ramstrom talks about the importance of physical distancing while recreating outdoors, making sure people are staying 6 feet apart and not interacting closely with people who are not in their household.</li>

<p>Isolation and quarantine both help protect the public by preventing exposure to people who have or may have a contagious disease. Isolation separates sick people with a contagious disease from people who are not sick. Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who were exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick.</p>

<div class="usa-accordion__content" id="briefing-2020-03-31">
<p>On Tuesdays and Thursdays, we’ll be posting written daily updates instead of a live press briefing.</p>
<p><strong>The following healthcare partners submitted reports for today:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.co.shasta.ca.us/index/hhsa" target="_blank"><strong>Shasta County Health and Human Services</strong></a></strong><strong>:</strong> After a thorough investigation, Shasta County Public Health is documenting its first case of community transmission of COVID-19. The patient, a man in his 80s, did not have travel history or contact with a known COVID-19 case. He remains hospitalized in isolation. Shasta County tests: 6 positive, 230 negative.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.dignityhealth.org/coronavirus-disease-2019" target="_blank"><strong>Mercy Medical Center Redding</strong></a></strong><strong>:</strong> Mercy Redding continues to refine our surge capacity, including patient placement, equipment and supply deployment, identification of additional negative pressure/isolation rooms, staffing needs for those identified locations, and staff training. Visitor restrictions remain in force, and employees are screened when coming to work. We continue to work with our vendors and suppliers to ensure our clinical staff can safely and appropriately take care of patients. Dignity Health Connected Living continues to serve thousands of high-risk residents with food distributions. Mercy Redding is offering a free virtual visit to anyone concerned about coronavirus. To access a free virtual urgent care visit, visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dignityhealth.org/virtualcareanywhere" target="_blank">www.dignityhealth.org/virtualcareanywhere</a>, download the Virtual Care Anywhere app in the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, or call 855-356-8053 and use the coupon code COVID19.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.shastaregional.com/Patients-Visitors/COVID-19-Patient-and-Visitor-Information.aspx" target="_blank"><strong>Shasta Regional Medical Center</strong></a></strong><strong>:</strong> Starting today, Tuesday, March 31, all employees will be screened prior to starting shifts, including temperature checks. We have also streamlined entrance to the hospital to only Main Entrance and our no visitor policy remains in place. We continue to monitor supplies and plan for any potential surge, including the setup of our Negative Pressure Unit that was completed last week. Current patients at Shasta Regional Medical Group may make appointments utilizing our Tele-Medicine system by calling 530-605-4260.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.shastahealth.org/covid19" target="_blank"><strong>Shasta Community Health Center</strong></a></strong><strong>:</strong> All campuses are open including Shasta Lake City and Anderson. We have closed all of our dental facilities except for dental emergencies for our patients at our downtown location in the Shasta College Health Sciences complex. We continue to screen all patients entering our facilities and have established a secondary screening facility at our main campus at 1035 Placer Street. We continue to make plans for a surge of patients with respiratory needs. We have moved many more of our visits (and we routinely do over 500 a day) to telephonic where we can. We are holding steady on personal protective equipment, watching our inventory and burn rate but looking for more items as an edge against a large surge of patients later on. We await the Abbott Labs-announced COVID point of care test kits that promise a positive result in 5 minutes and a negative result in 13 minutes. We await information on its sensitivities, however.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.redding-rancheria.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Redding Rancheria Tribal Health Center</strong></a></strong><strong>:</strong> We have been screening all patients and staff at all three health campuses since March 10. We are currently running two shifts, each shift is working 1 week on and having 1 week off in an effort to conserve staff, and keep them healthy both physically and emotionally. We have been doing phone call visits between providers and patients and will be allowing patients to schedule virtual visits with their providers starting Monday. We have an ample supply of personal protective equipment, but are running low on test kits. Our urgent care at Churn Creek Health Care is still operating 7 days a week with 2 doctors per day.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://www.mayersmemorial.com/getpage.php?name=Coronavirus_Information" target="_blank"><strong>Mayers Memorial Hospital District</strong></a></strong><strong>:</strong> We began a no-visitor policy on March 6, primarily because of our 90 skilled nursing residents. We have suspended all communal activities in the skilled nursing facility as of March 27. Our social workers and activities department are working to keep avenues of communication open to families and provide alternate activities for the residents. Mayers started screening all employees on March 16 and has a policy in place for screening and employee health. We continue to utilize only one entrance to our facility. We are able to use an isolation trailer to screen, evaluate and collect test specimens on patients if deemed necessary. Collaboration continues with Shasta Regional Medical Center and Mercy on our surge planning, close monitoring of inventory and burn rate of personal protective equipment and supporting our valuable workforce. Mayers has also been active in helping our community with the Groceries to Go program.</li>
